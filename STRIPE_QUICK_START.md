## 📝 3 Simple Steps to Activate Payments

### Step 1: Get Publishable Key (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Find **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
3. Click "Reveal test key" and copy it
4. Open `config.js` in your project
5. Replace line 44:
   ```javascript
   PUBLISHABLE_KEY: 'pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE',
   ```
   with your actual key

### Step 2: Get Price IDs (3 minutes)

**Option A - Use Price IDs (Recommended):**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products
2. Click on your **Pro** product
3. Copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_`)
4. Do the same for your **Pro+** product
5. Update `config.js` lines 46-47:
   ```javascript
   PRO_PRICE_ID: 'price_1234567890', // Your actual Pro price ID
   PRO_PLUS_PRICE_ID: 'price_0987654321', // Your actual Pro+ price ID
   ```

**Option B - Use Lookup Keys (Alternative):**
1. In Stripe Dashboard → Products → Edit each product
2. Add lookup keys:
   - Pro: `price_pro_monthly`
   - Pro+: `price_pro_plus_monthly`
3. Your config.js already has these keys configured!

### Step 3: Deploy and Test (2 minutes)

1. **Save config.js** with your keys
2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add config.js
   git commit -m "✅ Add Stripe keys"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to update
4. **Test your payment:**
   - Visit: https://alimehdi512.github.io/AI-Text-Humanizer-App/
   - Sign in with Google
   - Click user menu → "Upgrade Plan"
   - Select a plan → "Upgrade Now"
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any future expiry (e.g., 12/34)
   - Any CVC (e.g., 123)
   - Complete payment
   - You'll see the success page! 🎉

2. Redirected to Stripe Checkout (secure Stripe page)
3. Enters payment details
4. Stripe processes payment
5. Redirected to beautiful success page
6. Payment appears in your Stripe Dashboard
7. (Optional) Webhook updates subscription in your database

## 🎯 Current Setup

✅ **Frontend Integration**: Complete  
✅ **Stripe Checkout**: Ready  
✅ **Success/Cancel Pages**: Beautiful and functional  
✅ **Security**: No secrets exposed  
⚠️ **Your Keys**: Need to add to config.js  
⚠️ **Backend Webhook** (Optional): See STRIPE_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md  

---

## 🔒 Security Reminder

- ✅ **Publishable Key** (`pk_test_...`) is SAFE in frontend code
- ❌ **Secret Key** (`sk_test_...`) should NEVER be in frontend code
- ✅ Your secret key is safely stored in `stripe/server.py` (local only)
- ⚠️ Never commit secret keys to GitHub
- ✅ Use environment variables for secrets in production

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem: "Price ID not configured"**
- Solution: Make sure you added your Price IDs to config.js

**Problem: Checkout doesn't redirect**
- Solution: Check browser console for errors
- Verify your Publishable Key is correct
- Make sure Stripe.js loaded (check network tab)

**Problem: Payment succeeds but nothing happens**
- Solution: This is normal for now!
- The webhook integration is optional
- You can manually update subscriptions in Supabase
- Or implement the backend endpoint (see STRIPE_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md)
